## About me

My goals and wishes:

- I want to see the result of my work and have opportunities for creativity.
- My dream is to talk about my work as a hobby.
- I hope to be in a team where I will progress and become one of the best specialists in my field.

Why i decided to become a web developer:

- I've been looking for a programming area, that would really interest me for a long time. Only when I helped develop a site to one of my friends. I realized that I want to continue to do this. From that moment on, I am looking for development opportunities in the area of web-development.
- I believe that The Rolling Scopes School courses are a great opportunity to become a high-class developer and I will definitely take advantage of it.
